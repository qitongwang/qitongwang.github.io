                <h2>The Relationship Between Coal Mining Activity and Opioid Mortality.</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <p class="authors">Working paper with Gilbert E.Metcalf, Tufts University.</p>
            <p class="abstract">This paper uses restricted death data and coal production data to examine the relationship between coal mining activity and opioid overdose death. I ﬁnd a positive relationship between the share of coal miners among total local labor force and opioid mortality. When instrumenting with the price of natural gas, the results are very similar but less signiﬁcant. I conclude that simply shutting down coal mines may not effectively mitigate the opioid epidemic in the Appalachian region. The IV approach can partially solve the endogeneity problem but fails to distinguish different types of mines.</p>
