Hi, I am a fourth year PhD student in Economics at the University of Southern California. My research interests cover a board range of topics in macro-finance. Currently, I am interested in the safety feature of U.S. treasury. 

Prior to my study at USC, I finished my Master's degree in Economics at Tufts University, and Bachelor's degree in Energy Economics at Renmin University of China.
